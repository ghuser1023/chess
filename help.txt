PLAYING THE GAME

This game works mostly the same way chess does. The
following aspects have been altered:

CAPTURING: Pieces are no longer captured instantaneously;
it is patently ridiculous that a knight would be defeated
immediately by a single pawn. Rather, pieces have health
and attack statistics, and deal damage to other units when
they attack; units are removed from the board when their
health drops to or below zero.

ATTACKING: Pieces inflict damage in a certain radius
depending on whether or not they are melee (3x3 box) or ranged
(5x5 box). Pawns, Knights, Forts, and Kings are melee units,
while Bishops and Queens are ranged units (because they
have staffs rather than swords). Pieces do not move into the
space they attack, even if the attack destroys the
opposing unit.

SPECIAL RULES: En passant, castling, and pawn promotion
are no longer rules. Pawns are stuck when they reach the final
rank of the board, though they may still attack if enemy units
move into range.

MORALE: Units now have a morale statistic, which determines
their ability to be ordered around. Units with high morale
will certainly obey orders, while units with low morale may
reject orders outright.

TURNS: Your turn no longer ends after a single action. You
may move as many pieces or cast as many abilities as you
want in your turn, subject only to the rule that a single
piece may only take a single action in a turn. If a unit
disobeys, it is considered to have used its turn. Your turn
ends when you press the end turn button.

VICTORY CONDITIONS: You no longer win when you capture the
enemy king. The loss of the king leads to a large reduction
in morale; however, the battle is certainly not over. The
battle ends only when the opposing army is completely
destroyed or the opposing commander surrenders.

PIECE EXPERIENCE: Pieces can gain experience as they defeat
enemy units. When they gain enough experience, they level
up, gaining stat increases and better appearance. Level 3
is the maximum attainable level.

PIECE ABILITIES: In addition to attacking, pieces may elect
to use one of their "abilities". These abilities vary from
piece to piece, and have cooldown lengths until they can be
used again. Additionally, there are some abilities that
are not casted manually; rather, they are "passive" and
effective as long as the piece is alive. Abilities are also
affected by morale, failing more often if morale is low;
however, using an ability does not use up a piece's turn.

    PAWN ABILITIES
        Arrowstorm: ranged attack for the pawn. Casted at
            a target within range 2.
        Proletariat Solidarity: (passive ability) pawns gain
            attack and defense boosts whenever other friendly
            pawns are in range.

    FORT (ROOK) ABILITIES
        Aerial Defense: ranged attack for the fort. Casted
            at a target within range 2.
        Fortify: (passive ability) adjacent pieces gain
            defense boosts.

    KNIGHT ABILITIES
        Charge: moves the knight normally, buffing its attack.
        Chivalry: chooses a unit within range 2 to protect and
            buffs defense, redirecting any attacks on that unit
            to this knight.

    BISHOP ABILITIES
        Regeneration: heals target unit to full health.
        Piety: at range 2, all units gain temporary stat boosts.

    QUEEN ABILITIES
        Influence: sets all units' morale to 100 for 1 turn,
            effectively making every single action succeed the
            turncthis move is used.
        Subterfuge: at large range, calls in spies to damage
            and debuff target unit.

    KING ABILITIES:
        Call to Arms: spawns two mercenary pawns anywhere on
            the map.
        Rally: buffs morale significantly for a certain amount
            of turns.
